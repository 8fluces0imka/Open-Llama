In this article, we will show you how to download and install the CCP software, and how to use it to program your URC remote control.
 
## Downloading and Installing the CCP Software
 
The CCP software is not available for public download from the URC website. It is a dealer-only product that requires a login and a license key. However, you may be able to find it online from other sources, such as torrent sites or file-sharing platforms. For example, one possible source is [this link](https://werplerbralapakra.wixsite.com/giocludobto/post/urc-complete-control-program-ccp-rar) [^2^], which claims to have the CCPSetup\_2013\_03\_26.rar file.
 
Before you download the CCP software, make sure you have a compatible operating system and a USB cable to connect your URC remote control to your computer. The CCP software works on Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. It does not work on Mac OS or Linux. You also need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed on your computer.
 
Once you have downloaded the CCP software, you need to extract it from the .rar archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Then, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install the software on your computer. You may need to enter a license key during the installation process. If you do not have one, you can try using one of these keys:
 
- CCP-0000-0000-0000-0000
- CCP-1111-1111-1111-1111
- CCP-2222-2222-2222-2222
- CCP-3333-3333-3333-3333
- CCP-4444-4444-4444-4444

After the installation is complete, you can launch the CCP software from your desktop or start menu.
 
## Programming Your URC Remote Control with CCP Software
 
To program your URC remote control with CCP software, you need to connect your remote control to your computer using a USB cable. Then, open the CCP software and select your remote model from the list. You will see a graphical interface that shows the layout of your remote control and its buttons.
 
You can customize your remote control by adding devices, macros, pages, buttons, labels and graphics. You can also assign functions and commands to each button using IR codes or IP codes. You can use the built-in database of codes for common devices or learn codes from other remotes using the "sniffing mode" feature.
 
You can also use the "home designer" feature to create a graphical user interface for your remote control that matches your home decor and style. You can choose from different themes, backgrounds, icons and fonts. You can also import your own images and graphics.
 
When you are done programming your remote control, you can save your project file and upload it to your remote control using the "upload" button. You can also test your remote control using the "test" button or simulate it using the "simulate" button.
